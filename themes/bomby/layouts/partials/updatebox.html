<p><b>28/04/2021 (Wed) Devlog</b> - From now on, I'll just use this box for short website updates since the blogging system is set up! I've finally figured out how to automatically build and push my website to Neocities through GitLab Pipelines. Check out my full post on it <a href="http://localhost:14617/blog/2021-04-28/" class="whitelink">here!</a></p>
<p><b>23/04/2021 (Fri) Lifelog</b> - I've added Corq's website to my badges section! Thanks for
    leaving a comment. I love Kirby!
    My friends said they might make a website as well so that'll be fun. </p>
<p><b>23/04/2021 (Fri) Devlog</b> - I got animated cursors to work! I found an old thread
    which talked
    about it <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189250/animated-cursor-support-in-web-applications" class="whitelink">here</a>.
    It basically works by using CSS animations to replace the cursor at every percentage.
    (The
    second answer on the thread). I've yet to implement a personal blog yet, but I'm looking
    at how
    to do it! I'll also change the link cursor to an animated cursor at a later date.

<p><b>20/04/2021 (Tues) Lifelog</b> - Went to work today and went home to work on an album
    someone I
    knew from highschool commissioned me for. I think it looks rad! Also had uni class, but
    that's
    kinda insignificant hah. I'm thinking I'll add a proper lifelog page so that I don't
    have to mix
    up this space.</p>
<p><b>20/04/2021 (Tues) Devlog</b> - I rearranged the flexbox so that the comment box is at
    the
    bottom of the screen for mobile devices! I also fixed the button for <a
        href="http://www.rw-designer.com" class="whitelink">RealWorld Graphics</a>. I found the Kirby cursor
    on there
    yesterday!</p>
<p><b>19/04/2021 (Mon) Devlog</b> - Implemented Kirby cursors! My friends and I (bless your
    souls
    Wenorter and Shoshin) were trying to figure out how to get animated .ani cursor files to
    work
    for this website, but it turned out to be a lot too complicated, so I ended up having to
    settle
    down for a static cursor. <img

        href="https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/rendering-animated-ani-cursors-in-the-browser/" class="whitelink">
        ani-cursor</a> to work, please let me know how!</p>

    far
    away. <img height="40px"

<p><b>18/04/2021 (Sun) Devlog</b> - GraphComment comment box was added. YAY! This updates
    box was
    also created, along with the Random box. I also made the Bomby's and Animal Crossing
    button. Do
    you see the orange and yellow scrollbars? I like them.</p>
<p><b>17/04/2021 (Sat) Devlog</b> - Bomby's website was born! (With only the header.) I made
    a Kirby
    love button and a Stardew Valley one as well. Feel free to use them! ;)</p>
