[{"categories":["blog"],"content":"I’m so happy!!!\nI finally figured out how to get VSCode to build and push new changes of my Hugo website to Neocities automatically.\nThis problem took me so long to solve (with a lot of experimentation) because all the tools I found were far too technical for a n00b like me.\nSo… I’ll give you in a nutshell of how I did it! (Special thanks to Kirby Kevinson on the Penny’s Club discord server for giving me the hint of using GitLab.\n First of all, I changed my source code management platform from Github to GitLab. This is because I couldn’t get the Neocities Github actionsto work. 😞 I’m sure there’s nothing wrong with it, but I just couldn’t figure it out for the life of me (being completely new to webdev).\n Secondly, I came across Neocities GitLab CI, which allowed for the building and deployment of sites to Neocities on push. I copied all the files in there across to my own project (except for the public folder, since Hugo will build that for me).\n The readme.md of Neocities GitLab CIrequired me to make a GitLab file variable with my Neocities API, so I did that as well. You can add it under Settings\u003eCI/CD\u003eVariables (Expand this section!)\u003eAdd Variable in your project repository.\n Make sure your Add Variable dialogue look something like this with all the boxes ticked! (See above) In the Value box, type in your Neocities site API. You can find it if you go to: neocities.org/settings/[YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME-HERE]#api_key\nAfter setting this up, your depository should automatically push to Neocities every time you run “git push”. If you aren’t using a static site generator, then you’re good to go by this stage. If you use a Ruby-based static site generator (like Jekyll), you should be able to get this running pretty easily as well after editing the .gitlab-ci.yml file to install Jekyll and build it.\nHowever, since Hugo isn’t Ruby-based I had to make some small adjustments to the .gitlab-ci.yml file so that it builds and deploys in separate steps.\n …and it works! Every time I run git push on VSCode now, it’ll automatically build my static files through Hugo and deploy them to Neocities! You can find my modified Neocities .gitlab-ci.yml file here.\nSorry if I seem a little too excited for something this simple, but it was so hard to find anything that’s easy to understand for complete beginners! I hope that this helps some other people here too.\nTo-do: 1. figure out how to push my Hugo static files to Neocities automagically DONE!! YAY!\n2. Limit the front page to only have a snippet of the post (so that the \"read more...\" button has a purpose hehe) Done!\n3. Implement a search engine 4. Show tags/categories on the right column of the blog page 5. Show tags/categories at the bottom of each post 6. Make a template that I can use for my mark-down posts with the custom shortcodes for left-align and linebreaks Done  For inserting images\r- For left-aligning\r- For new lines --\r","description":"","tags":["blog","dev","hugo"],"title":"Woohoo!","uri":"/blog/2021-04-28/"},{"categories":["blog"],"content":"Now that I have a system (kinda) working with Hugo and Neocities, I can focus on just writing my blog! Yay. Today, I just went to work and had classes between my shifts. To be honest, the whole day, I was just thinking about how I can get my website to automatically push itself to Neocities… 😆\nI think I might’ve figured it out by using the Github actions: Deploy to Neocities. I’ll update to let you know if it actually works.\nClass today was fun… We just played around with inks and the like. Messy, but fun.\n To-do:  1.

Turns out all my blog posts had to follow the YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+15:00 (+15:00 is my timezone ahead of CST) in order for Hugo to render it properly.\nNow I just have to: 1.
