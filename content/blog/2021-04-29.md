I just downloaded the app [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) on my iPhone so that I can clone my git repository and create markdown files on the go!  I also got the app [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/bear/id1016366447) for nicer mark-down editing.

So far, it seems to be working really well! The only problem with this setup is that I canâ€™t really preview what the post will look like on my site (since I use Hugo shortcodes for some of my markdown). But since the formatting is so basic, I donâ€™t think it matters too much. Itâ€™ll work for now until I get a laptop! ðŸ˜Œ  


Right now, Iâ€™m just on the train to work until the afternoon. I might hold off tinkering with my website today so that I can get some work done for uni (and get some sleep!).  


Iâ€™m super happy I got yesterdayâ€™s to-do list for this website all done.  


{{< left >}}
To-do: <br>
<strike>1. Night-mode theme switching depending on user light mode_dark mode interfaces. (Thanks <a href="https://kirby.kevinson.org"> Kirby Kevinson </a> for your suggestion on Discord!)</strike> Done! (April 29 10:36PM)<br>
2. Add tag bar to the bottom of each post. <br>
3. Make post templates for Reviews (i.e. for games or shows etc.) <br>
4. Add custom emotes. <br>
5. Add a mood tracker on the top corner of each blog post.
