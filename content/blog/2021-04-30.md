I swear 9am lectures are my worst enemies... Especially when the next class is at 1:30pm!! They should've just kept the lecture before class... It's not the worst thing in the world though, since I usually go to a cafe with my friends in the down-time.

Learning about street posters. :bowtie:  

Sitting at the back is fun because I can see what everyone else is distracted by...

Lol... Someone isn't paying attention... :point_up_2:  

I need to grab a coffee after this lecture. (I don't even like coffee, but I'll grab a mocha mmmm). :coffee: Stayed up too late last night wokring on darkmode for the website. So weird how it flickers on mobile in portrait mode, but works fine on my iPad and computer. The button to make the buttons bigger/smaller also breaks when you enter darkmode for some reason.  

Bah humbug, I'll figure it out another time! I think the other stuff may be priority atm.
