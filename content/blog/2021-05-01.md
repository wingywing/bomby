Today, I tried to do something cool for my upcoming assignment with code.  
Unfortunately, being the big noob I am, I couldn't really figure it out.  
I wanted to create a map with pictures overlaid on certain coordinates, and tried to use [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) to do it.  
For most of the day, I was figuring out how to use npm and browserify to run packages...  I'm happy that I learnt how to use them!  

As for the map, I actually did manage to embed it onto the page, but I couldn't understand how to project a static image onto specific coordinates.  
You can take a look [here](/projects/catmap/)! 
Not exciting at all since it's just a map, but it's better than nothing. :sob:  

I might try to use Google Maps API instead just because the documentation is easier to read (for me).

There's also a super secret [/projects](/projects/) page that I made... Just kidding, it's not in the nav-bar since I haven't finished anything yet, but check it out! :wink:
