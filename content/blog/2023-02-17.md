Oh wow, it's been almost two years since I last updated this site...  

So so so much have happened in these last two years. I got a job working as a Junior UI/UX designer at an awesome place and learnt more about code as well!
There are so many things I could do better with this site structurally...
I still love it though! This is the first web project that I've completed myself. :D

I'll try to build another site though! With skills I learnt on the job maybe hehe.

Oh long story short, I'll finally be able to go on my exchange to Japan next month!
I'll be at Niigata for 11 months, so that's pretty big. :O

This means that my bf and I will have to do long distance until I come back...

I think we can do it! In fact he reminded me that this site existed and inspired me to post again hehe.
We'll be working on our own project together though. (He's an IT guy!)
I'm so happy and glad that I have someone so cool as my partner.

Last year was quite a rollercoaster ride with me ending a relationship of three years. However, I'm more than happy to say that my current partner
is more than I can ever wish for! There's just an immense sense of comfort and fun when we're together...
