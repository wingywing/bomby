Now that I have a system (kinda) working with Hugo and Neocities, I can focus on just writing my blog! Yay. Today, I just went to work and had classes between my shifts. To be honest, the whole day, I was just thinking about how I can get my website to automatically push itself to Neocities... :satisfied:

I think I might've figured it out by using the Github actions: [Deploy to Neocities](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities). I'll update to let you know if it actually works.

Class today was fun... We just played around with inks and the like. Messy, but fun.

4. Implement a search engine  {{< br >}}
