Hey guys,

Quick update today since I got carried away by this website again (it always happen out of nowhere I swear!), but it's already 1:22am where I am! (Ohno... and I've got work tomorrow morning)

## I'm trying out something new (again)

This something new is Front Matter â€“ a CMS extension for VS Code that lets me write my markdown for my blogposts using WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get).

I'm using Hugo right now (as you might remember) to static generate my site. So this really makes the writing experience easier for me haha.

You can find it [here](https://frontmatter.codes/).

It's pretty darn cool!
