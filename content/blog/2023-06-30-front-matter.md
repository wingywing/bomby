Hey guys,

Quick update today since I got carried away by this website again (it always happen out of nowhere I swear!), but it's already 1:22am where I am! (Ohno... and I've got work tomorrow morning)

I'm trying out something new (again)

This something new is Front Matter â€“ a CMS extension for VS Code that lets me write my markdown for my blogposts using WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get).

<!--more-->

I'm using Hugo right now (as you might remember) to static generate my site. So this really makes the writing experience easier for me haha.

You can find it [here](https://frontmatter.codes/).

It's pretty darn cool!

To-do: <br>
1. Add tag bar to the bottom of each post. <br>
2. Make post templates for Reviews (i.e. for games or shows etc.) <br>
3. Add custom emotes. <br>
4. Add a mood tracker on the top corner of each blog post.
