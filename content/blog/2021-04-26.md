I haven't published the website yet since I'm still trying to figure out how to get the date and images showing properly for the blog...

Edit: I've figured out how to do the dates properly! Turns out all my blog posts had to follow the YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+15:00 (+15:00 is my timezone ahead of CST) in order for Hugo to render it properly.

Now I just have to: {{< br >}}
1. Implement a template for individual pages for each blog post  {{< br >}}
2. figure out how to push my Hugo static files to Neocities automagically  {{< br >}}
3. Limit the front page to only have a snippet of the post (so that the "read more..." button has a purpose hehe)  {{< br >}}
4. Implement a search engine  {{< br >}}
5. Show tags/categories on the right column of the blog page"  {{< br >}}
