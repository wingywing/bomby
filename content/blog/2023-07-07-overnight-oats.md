Let's start with the recipe and then get to the life story hehe.

## Ingredients: 
1. Dutched cocoa power – 2 tbsp
2. Rolled oats – 1/2 cup
3. Erythritol (or sugar/honey/sweetener of choice) – 2 tsp
4. Kinako, sesame and almond powder (optional) – 2 tbsp
5. Water/milk (or milk alternatives) – see in recipe!
6. Toppings of your choice (fruits, peanut butter, nuts, greek yoghurt etc.)

<!--more-->
## Recipe
1. Lay rolled outs on the bottom of your container (can be a jar or tupperware or anything, really)
2. In another bowl, mix all the other dry ingredients
3. Gradually add water/milk to the powder while mixing until the poweder is a creamy but runny texture
4. Pour the mixture on your oats and add toppings that you'd like soften overnight.
5. Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, or overnight!
6. Enjoy eating it – feel free to add more toppings :)

## Thoughts and blabbering

So easy, right?

I got a batch of protein whey from Amazon for the sole purpose of experimenting with recipes and found out the wonderful invention that is overnight oats...
<br/><br/>
The idea of getting whey protein to begin with came from <a href="https://imheatherr.com/boos-ridiculous-brownies/">Boo's Ridiculous Brownies</a> when I was looking for low carb sweets that I can try making. I didn't have erythritol on hand, so when I made her recipe I used no sugar or sweeteners (other than the diet soda) and it isn't very popular at parties. I like it though! 
<br/><br/>
But now that I <i>do</i> have erythritol and protein powder, I'll 100% try it again. Just not this week... Since I've had so many experimental brownies last week haha.
<br/><br/>
I'm pretty sure I'll be sick of chocolate/cocoa flavoured things soon after eating so much of it these days.
<br/><br/>
Not sure though hmm!
