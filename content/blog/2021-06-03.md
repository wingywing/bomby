Haven't posted for almost a while, but I'm done with uni for the semester!  
I coded a website showcasing my poster and zine design for an assignment.  
I'd say I'm pretty happy with the result.  

This holidays, I want to get better at coding and design some materials for my Caf√© Club. I'm excited for it to get up and running!

Other than that, I recently finished a Chinese romcom drama set in a fictional historical China. The english name of the drama is: "The Romance of Tiger and Rose". I'd say that it was a good laugh and a very light-hearted watch. Maybe I'll make a review post for it tomorrow... (That is if I get to starting on my to-do list tomorrow hehe)  

I also resubscribed to FFXIV for the month. I think I'm not super great at playing MMOs anymore since I lose interest very quickly. Probably wasn't worth the $30.  

I'm looking forward to going out with friends a bit more these two months.  :smile:
