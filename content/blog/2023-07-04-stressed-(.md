Writing this in the middle of class at the moment. Just needed to rant a bit, but university has been stressful these days.

I have a research methodology task due in two weeks, but with classes and work, it's hard to fit it into my schedule.

I'll do my best to finish all of the introduction and methodology part by the end of today so that I can gather user data through surveys by mid next week.

Hopefully next week I can finish all the analysis and discussions with enough data!

I believe that I can pull through but time is tight!
