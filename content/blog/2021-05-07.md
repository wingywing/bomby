I've been busy the last few days working on the [catmap](/projects/catmap), and I got the Google Maps API to work the way I want it to!  

So far, I have 40 pictures, but I still need 60 more for the assignment criteria.  

It was interesting to look at the different interpretations of cats around the world, and the myths and stories that follow... 

I'll finish up with those on the weekend!
