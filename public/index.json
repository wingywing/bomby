[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m so happy!!!\nI finally figured out how to get VSCode to build and push new changes of my Hugo website to Neocities automatically.\nThis problem took me so long to solve (with a lot of experimentation) because all the tools I found were far too technical for a n00b like me.\nSo\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll give you in a nutshell of how I did it! (Special thanks to Kirby Kevinson on the Penny\u0026rsquo;s Club discord server for giving me the hint of using GitLab.\n","permalink":"http://bomby.neocities.org/blog/2021-04-28/","title":"Woohoo!"},{"content":"Now that I have a system (kinda) working with Hugo and Neocities, I can focus on just writing my blog! Yay. Today, I just went to work and had classes between my shifts. To be honest, the whole day, I was just thinking about how I can get my website to automatically push itself to Neocities\u0026hellip; ðŸ˜†\nI think I might\u0026rsquo;ve figured it out by using the Github actions: Deploy to Neocities. I\u0026rsquo;ll update to let you know if it actually works.\nClass today was fun\u0026hellip; We just played around with inks and the like. Messy, but fun.\n","permalink":"http://bomby.neocities.org/blog/2021-04-27/","title":"Just a work and uni kinda day..."},{"content":"I haven\u0026rsquo;t published the website yet since I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to figure out how to get the date and images showing properly for the blog\u0026hellip;\n Edit: I\u0026rsquo;ve figured out how to do the dates properly! Turns out all my blog posts had to follow the YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+15:00 (+15:00 is my timezone ahead of CST) in order for Hugo to render it properly.\n","permalink":"http://bomby.neocities.org/blog/2021-04-26/","title":"Second Post!"},{"content":"I just migrated my static website to Hugo! This will make it easier for me to do blog posts. :D","permalink":"http://bomby.neocities.org/blog/2021-04-25/","title":"First Post!"}]
